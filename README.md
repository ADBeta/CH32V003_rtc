# CH32V003 RTC Demonstation Code

This demo code shows how to set the CH32V003 up to act as a Real Time Clock
IC, via a 32.768KHz XTAL Oscillator (and later a regular xtal using the opamp)
connected to `PD4`


## Circuit
`Circuit 1` uses a 32.768KHz XTAL Oscillator which provides an accurate square
wave, directly to GPIO pin `PD4`.
